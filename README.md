# Sports Scheduler

## This is an application built on NodeJS.

A sports scheduler is a tool that helps you plan and organize sports events or tournaments. It can help you set the dates, times, venues and teams for each game or match.
The application contains two personas admin and player. 
Admins can create a sport, create a session by giving the details about the session, join sessions created by others, leave session and cancel the session.
Player can also perform all the above tasks except creating a sport.
