# Sports Scheduler

## Sports scheduler is an application built on NodeJS.

### A sports scheduler is a tool that helps you plan and organize sports events or tournaments. It can help you set the dates, times, venues and teams for each game or match.

### The application contains two personas admin and player. 
### Admins can create a sport, create a session by giving the details about the session, join other sessions and cancel the session.
### Player can also perform all the above tasks except creating a sport.
